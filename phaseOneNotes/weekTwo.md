# Day 1
## Basic HTML Elements, Metadata HTML Elements, Content Grouping HTML Elements, Text Level Semantic HTML Elements

- Jerome shared his screen and went through the basic structure of an html document. He asked questions such as, “what comes next?” as he went through to check for understanding. He used an html boilerplate to set the initial structure of the html document, linked the stylesheet, put a header in, made a container div, made several divs, added an image, and made <p> tags. He gave us several opportunities to take 3 minutes and do whatever we wanted to with the page on our branch on our local machine. He introduced us to favicons (small images or logos often used in website tabs). If you want to take a look at the work that was done on the html page, pull down the changes to the March2021 repo to your local machine and the page we built is under the html-and-css folder. Make sure that if you start playing around with it, it’s on your own branch.

- Jerome showed us what root css variables are. He said they are the same as universal selectors. An article about it is here https://www.color-hex.com/color/bada55  . Also we went over how to style the nav bar using flex.  Also there’s some default styling we applied that had to do with accessibility. Go to http://meyerweb.com/Eric/tools/css/reset to see those default stylings.

- Jerome showed us the workflow for GitHub. It goes something like this:
  1. Clone down a repo or if it’s already on your machine pull or rebase to get the latest changes
  2. Make your own branch
  3. Make changes
  4. Push the changes
  5. Pull request and review from a teammate
  6. merge changes
  7. Delete branch to declutter

- Homework:
- Use what you learned in class (root variables, default stylings) to your prework project and see how much it changes it. You may have to     
  readjust your project to account for these stylings. http://meyerweb.com/Eric/tools/css/reset
- Look at the structure of the html document and the css document that we made. 

# Day 2
## Content Embedding, HTML Elements, Images / Multimedia HTML Elements, Global HTML Attributes, Growth Mindset

- Jerome spoke on growth mindset and touched on the importance of taking initiative with the learning process. GM is founded in the belief that a person's capacities and talents can be improved over time.
- Content Embedding HTML Elements - we discussed what an eye frame is and what it does.  It is basically in embed code that should get from videos posted on the Internet from sites such as YouTube and it allows you to embed videos in your webpage.
- Images / Multimedia HTML Elements - You can also use our frames to embed things like music we connected a song to the webpage from Spotify which came from the movie 28 days later and goes with our zombie theme
- Styling Text - we talked about additional tags that are used to segment and identify certain types of text content
  1. The <del> element

  3. The <ins> element

  4. The <strong> element
