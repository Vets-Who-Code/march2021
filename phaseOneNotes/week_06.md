# Day 1
## Primitives, Datatypes, and Hoisting 
- new requirement hotreload on the click of a button change to Korean switching Google API language on the hot reload keep the data saved in browser cache or local storage
- Javascript used the name because it was a marketing ploy 
- Javascript was a scripting language that was created to compete with aplets
- Ecmascript is the offical name 
- REST API for datalayer, serverless technology, etc
- Javascript can help you build and do everything 
- Hoisting 
example:
var hoist;
console.log(hoist);
hoist = 'The variable has been hoisted.";
### Variables
- var is for global variables that will change
- let is for global variables that will chance
- const is for global variables that will NOT change. const is good for security purposes and sometimes required. Const is for glocal variables that will NOT change
- example for let:
  function WhatIsLet(sum) {
     let whatIsThis = " This can be changed is within lexical - or local - scope.";
     return sum + 1;  
     console.log(whatIsThis)
}

console.log(whatIsLet(2))
- You can hoist a function too. 
- You cannot hoist 
- be consistent with semi-colons
- data types:
String	represents textual data	'hello', "hello world!" etc
Number	an integer or a floating-point number	3, 3.234, 3e-2 etc.
BigInt	an integer with arbitrary precision	900719925124740999n , 1n etc.
Boolean	Any of two values: true or false	true and false
undefined	a data type whose variable is not initialized	let a;
null	denotes a null value	let a = null;
Symbol	data type whose instances are unique and immutable	let value = Symbol('hello');
Object	key-value pairs of collection of data	let student = { };
- NAN is a property of a global object (like the planet Pluto);
