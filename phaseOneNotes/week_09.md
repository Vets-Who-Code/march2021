# Day 1
## Portfolios 
- used trackthis.link to view many examples of luxury websites that use black and white themes
- luxury websites use sans-serif fonts
- portfolios should have a flow to them or a common theme
## APIs
- API means application programming interface
-  that defines interactions between multiple software applications or mixed hardware-software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc.
### REST 
- REST API is the most popular version 
- REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database functions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (also known as CRUD) within a resource. For example, a REST API would use a GET request to retrieve a record, a POST request to create one, a PUT request to update a record, and a DELETE request to delete one. All HTTP methods can be used in API calls. A well-designed REST API is similar to a website running in a web browser with built-in HTTP functionality.
### GraphQL
- data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data
- provides an alternative to REST
- offers tools for complex queries and a less-is-more approach to fetch calls
- GraphQL have schemas and database like behaviors
- GraphQL behaves in a geospacial manner
- GraphQL is about asking different objects for the value of a specific field. The advantage here is that GraphQL always knows exactly what information you need and returns only the data you want.
### SOAP
- SOAP is more complex and older. 
- Complexity  lends itself to security, however SOAP isnt used as much in recent times.
- SOAP only allows XML, which is not nearly as straightforward to create.
