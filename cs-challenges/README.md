# Welcome to CS!

My name is [Phil Tenteromano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tenteromano/)

We will study some introductory concepts of computer science together.
More to come.

## To run a file:
1. cd into the challenge you want to try.
2. You should have `node` installed. If you don't... do it.
3. Run the file with `node path_to_file.js`
    - If no error happens but you didn't see anything; are you logging anything?

## How to get started testing your files:

1. In your terminal, make sure you are in the `cs-challenges` folder
2. If you have yarn, run: `yarn install` or if you have npm, run: `npm install`.
3. To run tests, cd into the challenge folder and run `yarn test test.js` (`yarn jest` also works).
    - Replace `yarn` with `npm` if you have npm instead.
    - Note: `test.js` assumes you are inside the challenge folder you want to run. If you are not, make sure its the correct path to the test file.
